<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

**ADVICE HUB** is a simple one page website. It shows many advices and quotes of great persons
and can be followed in life. The website shows the advice or quotes and also the name of the
author who has given the quote. I have used go lang to make the backend of this project.
Used HTML, CSS and Javascript for the forontend. And used sqlite as the database.

## Getting Started

Working with the website is pretty easy. You can easily get a piece of advice by clicking on the 
seek advice button.
You can visit this github repo by click on the github repo button.

### API Usage

You can use our api which has many advices and their authors.
The following operation are performed on the API -
* `GET` the all the advices.
* `GET` only one advice with a specific id.
* `POST` an advice to the api
* `PUT` - update a specific api
* `GET` a random advice from the advices in the advice api.

You has only access to the get operations but you cannot add or update the advices.

Just go to the website and perform these -
* To GET all the advices put /advices
* To GET a specific advice put /advices/:id
* To GET a random advice put /suradvice

Else commands can be done by the admin, i.e **ME**
